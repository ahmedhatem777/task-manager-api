# Task-Tracker

### Background:

This project is the back-end for [TT-front-end](https://github.com/ahmedhatem777/TT-front-end), it is a simple bug/task tracker where users can sign up, sign in, add, remove, update and view tasks and more, you can try it on [tt.ahmed-hatem.com](https://tt.ahmed-hatem.com).

The back-end server was made using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and the database using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), the list of packages/dependencies that helped build this project can be found in the package.json file.

The back-end server and the database are hosted on the free tiers of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), so bear with me if it's a bit slow :).
